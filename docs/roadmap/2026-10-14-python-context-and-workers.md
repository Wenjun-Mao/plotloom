# Python context reuse and bounded worker experiment

Status: owner approved on October 14, 2026; implementation and measurement in
progress. This continues the [testing-health plan](2026-10-10-testing-health-cleanup.md),
not a redefinition of its 85-percent complete-suite wall-time target.

## Authority and baseline

The owner approved operation-local production Script/Storyboard context reuse
and experimentation with four Python workers. Eight workers are permitted only
after measured memory/isolation headroom. The released default remains two.
Broader Production Bridge reuse, cross-operation caching and coverage reduction
are excluded. [ADR 0167](../adr/0167-operation-local-storyboard-context.md)
records the production boundary before implementation.

The isolated checkout is `python85-profiling`, branch
`codex/python85-query-qualification`, starting at `a14e81ed4cc3c3e601771e3aa7b720c678dc49ce`.
Its executable source matches the current released main baseline. The last
qualified complete Python measurement was 1,859 cases / 182 files in 633.23s
externally at `bafb1587`: 9.21% below the previous 697.496s, one comparison
combining fixture and schedule changes. The original 85-percent target is open.

The CLI worker committed its diagnostic checkpoint at `7b30ad3d`, is idle and
released the shared source/check window. The manager is the sole writer and
check owner for this Python slice. CLI generation, native probes and source
changes stay held; read-only review may proceed independently.

## Deliverables

1. Resolve Script context once in each Storyboard context operation. Reuse one
   resolved base context for accepted and candidate projections inside one
   uninterrupted `get_state` read, preserving each frozen timing/render mode.
   Empty state resolves no upstream context. Every separate read resolves fresh
   context; write/admission/commit/rollback boundaries are unchanged.
2. Expose an explicit experimental worker count through the existing complete
   Python runner, not an alternate runner or environment override. Default two;
   experimental choices two/four/eight. Verify each worker's exact assigned
   native case-ID fingerprint, not just file membership or case counts.
3. Run a matched quiet two-versus-four complete Python comparison on the same
   reviewed candidate, dependency/toolchain inputs and native case inventory,
   with fresh temporary roots and exact coverage. Capture external wall time,
   simultaneous aggregate owned-process-tree RSS (including Node), memory
   pressure/swap observations and cleanup. Consider eight only if four supplies
   evidence of headroom. More compute is not original fixed-resource success.

## Root cause and verification

Storyboard currently asks Script to resolve context in its stale check and then
resolves it again; accepted plus candidate state repeats that pair. The owner
read knows these comparisons belong to one uninterrupted operation. Pure
binding comparison belongs at that boundary, not in caller-side validation
bypasses or a session/global cache.

Before production edits, time these unchanged whole files through `focused`:
`test_script_storyboard_diagnostics.py`, `test_accepted_review_lifecycle.py`,
`test_storyboard_brief_style.py`, `test_storyboard_review_timing.py`,
`test_autopilot_image_safety.py` and `test_production_bridge.py` (all under
`tests/`). Repeat that exact union after the change. New focused guards cover
diagnostic ordering and all accepted-Script error mappings, empty/dual state,
independent 8/12-second and omitted/frozen render policies, successive-read
freshness and fresh write-boundary refusal. Do not add nested profile timings
or extrapolate these file measurements into whole-suite gains.

Runner checks cover exact case-ID proof, malformed/missing/duplicate completion
markers, four-worker whole-file isolation, partial startup failure and SIGTERM
descendant cleanup. Then independently review the stable combined candidate.
Reserve the final full release gate for that stable candidate; focused checks
or the Python-only experiment do not qualify the other release gates. Preserve
unchanged evidence only where its actual source/dependency inputs still match.

## Stopping and release

Stop for new authority if a finding requires scope beyond the operation-local
read or bounded concurrency experiment. Do not weaken diagnostics, skip tests,
increase default concurrency or claim 85 percent from estimates. Record actual
measurements and limitations, qualify the release candidate, then integrate and
push the scoped work under the normal repository policy. CLI integration and
live activation remain separate; no existing creative run is resumed here.

## Operation-local checkpoint

The first production slice is implemented. Twelve new focused regressions
passed, including one Script resolution for dual state, zero for empty state,
distinct error mappings, independent frozen policies and fresh refusal after a
normal Script mutation. Independent read-only review (requested GPT-6.1 Sol /
Medium; effective settings unverified) found no concrete findings. Existing
accepted-lifecycle cases cover retained-stale/current-candidate separation.

The exact six-file, 77-case union above passed before and after the source
change. External wall time was **130.15s before / 117.79s after** (9.50% less);
pytest reported 121.74s / 109.51s. Both commands exited zero. This is one quiet
focused pair, not a whole-suite or repeated-median speed claim. Logs are in
`.local/remaining-cost/operation-context-before-fGZr2z/focused.log` and
`.local/remaining-cost/operation-context-after-JDkaf0/focused.log`.
No full gate, new complete-suite measurement or worker-count experiment has
run on this slice yet. The two/four experiment remains the next deliverable.
